%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to

% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

Rare diseases have different definitions from countries. In Europe, a disease or disorder has less than 1 affection in 2,000 people called rare. In USA, a disease affects less than 200,000 Americans defined as rare [1]. Unlike influence of a single rare disease, the rare diseases in a whole affect around 6\%-8\% of the general population and the 50\% of patients are children [1, 2]. Based on the rarity of these diseases, a general physician may not likely have a single patient in his/her whole career [3]. Furthermore, the diagnosis of these diseases are relatively hard, because the symptoms often vary between individual causes [4]. Therefore, it is important to refer patients to an appropriate healthcare expert who are familiar with the specific disease and symptom set. In order to create a good match between rare disease patients and experts, we created a novel machine learning application by implementing SVM regression on OMIM publication data [5, 6]. By using this machine learning approach, we distinguished 2,1224 experts over 209,110 people with publications in 1,292 diseases.

\section{Data Processing}
\label{data_proc}

In order to evaluate if a person is an expert or not, we have to establish a metrics to measure expertise first. In our project, the metrics are based on people?s publications. On OMIM, which is an online catalog of rare diseases and disorders, each rare disease or symptom has a specific OMIM ID [6]. Under each OMIM ID, related research or clinical publications are included in the Reference Section. We scraped the publication data by using OMIM API and stored them into Python dictionaries [6, 7].Figure 1: Flow of Experiment ProcessThe original OMIM data are not formatted. In order to use OMIM data, we have to reorganized them into a data structure which is a dictionary in this case and extract useful information. The useful information includes OMIM ID, disease name, publication list. Each publication contains a unique PubMed ID and we stored publication information, such as paper title, author names and journal name, under each PubMed ID. In the part of author name processing, we found GeneReviews author names had a different format from OMIM author names. Therefore, GeneReviews author names had been parsed into the same format as OMIM author names which only include full last name, first name initial and middle name initial.Features are the keys for drawing classification boundaries or fitting regression lines [8, 9]. In our algorithm, there were 8 features had been chosen: number of publications on the disease1, normalized number of publications on the disease2, number of diseases that the author has publication on3, number of publications as first author on the disease4, number of publications as last author on the disease5 and the number of publications on the disease in 3 years6, 5 years7 or 10 years8. Feature 1 represents the person?s research ability on the disease in general. Feature 2 shows a relative research ability compared with other researchers on the same disease. Feature 3 reveals if a person?s research interest focus on one specific disease or for many diseases in general. Feature 4 and 5 provide weights to the impact from authorship. The last three features represent the effect from time of publications. After extracting features from the meta data, mapping from GeneReviews to OMIM ID has been made. GeneReviews is an authorized resource which provides relative information for inherited conditions. The articles are written by one or more expert on the specific condition or disease [10]. We used GeneReviews expert data as our positive dataset. We filtered people with no publications, because our analysis was based on publications. After mapping, there were 2,160 positive data points and 206,950 unknown data points. We randomly marked 2,160 unknown points as negative. Then we used both positive and negative data to train different learning algorithms, which include SVM classification [11], random forest [12] and naive Bayes [13], and compared the results. We used 10 times tenfold cross-validation to make the results more accurate [14].

\section{General formatting instructions}
\label{gen_inst}

The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas)
wide and 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch
(9~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing (leading) of
11~points.  Times New Roman is the preferred typeface throughout, and
will be selected for you by default.  Paragraphs are separated by
\nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no indentation.

The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold,
centered between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points
thick and the bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow
\nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and below the title to rules. All
pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.

For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each
name is centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's
name is to be listed first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if
different address) are set to follow. If there is only one co-author,
list both author and co-author side by side.

Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.

\section{Headings: first level}
\label{headings}

All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper
nouns), flush left, and bold.

First-level headings should be in 12-point type.

\subsection{Headings: second level}

Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\subsubsection{Headings: third level}

Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.

\paragraph{Paragraphs}

There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the
heading in bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the
heading followed by 1\,em of space.

\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
\label{others}

These instructions apply to everyone.

\subsection{Citations within the text}

The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.
Citations may be author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain
internal consistency.  As to the format of the references themselves,
any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently.

The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
\begin{center}
  \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
\end{center}
Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations
appropriate for use in inline text.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
   \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
\end{verbatim}
produces
\begin{quote}
  Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
\end{quote}

If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may
add the following before loading the \verb+nips_2016+ package:
\begin{verbatim}
   \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
\end{verbatim}

If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add
the optional argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[nonatbib]{nips_2016}
\end{verbatim}

As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the
third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et
al.\ [4],'' not ``In our previous work [4].'' If you cite your other
papers that are not widely available (e.g., a journal paper under
review), use anonymous author names in the citation, e.g., an author
of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote,
indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
  footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the
page on which they appear.  Precede the footnote with a horizontal
rule of 2~inches (12~picas).

Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
marks.\footnote{As in this example.}

\subsection{Figures}

All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
enough for purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption
always appear after the figure. Place one line space before the figure
caption and one line space after the figure. The figure caption should
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); figures are
numbered consecutively.

You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure
captions and the paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in
either black/white or in color.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
  \caption{Sample figure caption.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table
number and title always appear before the table.  See
Table~\ref{sample-table}.

Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
numbered consecutively.

Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical
  rules.} We strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package,
which allows for typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
\begin{center}
  \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
\end{center}
This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.

\begin{table}[t]
  \caption{Sample table title}
  \label{sample-table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
    \cmidrule{1-2}
    Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
    \midrule
    Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
    Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
    Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Final instructions}

Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style
files.  In particular, do not modify the width or length of the
rectangle the text should fit into, and do not change font sizes
(except perhaps in the \textbf{References} section; see below). Please
note that pages should be numbered.

\section{Preparing PDF files}

Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and
not, for example, ``A4.''

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file
must only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few
instructions to achieve this.

\begin{itemize}

\item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.

\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
  select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show
  All Fonts. You can also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes
  with \verb+xpdf+ and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux
  machines.

\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose
  fonts are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
  \url{http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf}

\item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap
  fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead.

\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You
  should use the equivalent AMS Fonts:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{amsfonts}
\end{verbatim}
followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or
\verb+\mathbb{C}+ for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You
can also use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex:
\begin{verbatim}
   \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
   \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
   \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
\end{verbatim}
Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the
\verb+amssymb+ package.

\end{itemize}

If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we
will ask you to fix it.

\subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}

Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
\verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always
specify the figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the
example below:
\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
\end{verbatim}
See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
(\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})

A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly
hyphenate a line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the
\verb+\-+ command when necessary.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All
acknowledgments go at the end of the paper. Do not include
acknowledgments in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper.

\section*{References}

References follow the acknowledgments. Use unnumbered first-level
heading for the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable
as long as you are consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font
size to \verb+small+ (9 point) when listing the references. {\bf
  Remember that you can use a ninth page as long as it contains
  \emph{only} cited references.}
